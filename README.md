#### A Github Search app where interested users can search for their GitHub details.

#### By **Patrick Mwangangi**
## Description
This a nifty web application created to serve as a platform where interested users are able to search for their's or other user's GitHub information. A brief user bio and repository details are displayed for the user. Should a user be interested to view the actual repository, a link is available to help in smooth navigation.

Further to the above usage, this master piece was created as practice on concepts learnt in Angular (at Moringa School).

It was created using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1 and GitHub Api.
